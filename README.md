## This is my flexbox Assignment
I wrote down the HTML code after carefully going through the pictures we were to recreate and wrote the css codes to style the page.



## How i wrote my HTML codes
1. Within the body tag i inputted a main tag
2. within the main tag, i inputted three div tags
3. in the first div tag, i inputted the image icon in the first picture i'm to recreate.
4. After that, i inputted an H2 tag which contains the name of the vehicle as shown in the picture.
5. I also wrote down the text within a p tag. Then, I created a button showing Learn More.
6. I did same for the other two div tags i inputted.
7. I gave the button different classes to make the styling easier.


## How i styled my page
1. I created an external CSS file and linked it in the head section in my HTML file
2. I removed the default padding in the page.
3. I gave the background color of my page hsl(0, 0%, 95%).
4. From the picture, the rectangular boxes containing the image, h2, p and button were identical so i gave them same width, height, font family, padding and ine height.  
5. I gave the parent container of my divs- main a display of flex, flex-wrap of wrap, justify-content of center, align-content of center, border-top-right-radius of 10px, and margin-top of 120px.
6. I styled the divs according to their background colors and border radius.
7. i styled the button same but gave them different colors according to the pictures we are to recreate.
8. I styled all the H2 and P tags the same way.
9. For the hover button, I made the background color transparent so as to inherit the parent background color. I also gave it a color of white and a cursor of pointer.
10. The font famiy i used were imported.
11. To make my page responsive on a smaller device, i assigned column to the flex direction of my main tag and also changed the border radius of the first and last div.
